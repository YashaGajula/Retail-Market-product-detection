Bounding Box Detection: Once the image is uploaded, the model will detect and visualize bounding boxes around objects in the image.

Predictions in JSON: After the detection, click the Get Predictions button to receive the predictions in JSON format.

5) You can also run 'python detection_all_images.py' to get JSON predictions of all the given 'sample_images' which is saved in 'predictions_output_batch'.
